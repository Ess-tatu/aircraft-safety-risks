# ‚úàÔ∏è Aircraft Safety Risks Analysis

This project provides data-driven insights into aircraft safety risks to guide a company seeking to expand into aviation. Using historical accident and incident data from the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB), this project analyzes accident trends, identifies high-risk aircraft types, and provides actionable recommendations to support safe fleet acquisition and operation.

## üìä Project Overview

A company planning to enter the aviation sector is evaluating potential aircraft for purchase. This project answers the key question:  
**"Which aircraft types present the lowest safety risks for initial acquisition and operation?"**

The CRISP-DM methodology is applied to explore patterns in historical aviation accidents, uncovering risk factors tied to aircraft type, flight phase, weather, and more.

## üìÅ Dataset

- **Source**: [NTSB Aviation Accident and Incident Data](https://www.ntsb.gov)
- **Time Period**: 1962 ‚Äì 2023
- **Rows**: 88,889 entries  
- **Columns**: 31 features including injury severity, aircraft make/model, engine type, phase of flight, and weather conditions.

## üß† Methodology

The analysis follows the CRISP-DM framework:

1. **Business Understanding** ‚Äì Define project objectives aligned with fleet acquisition.
2. **Data Understanding** ‚Äì Inspect, clean, and preprocess the NTSB dataset.
3. **Data Analysis** ‚Äì Use statistical summaries and visualizations to uncover trends.
4. **Conclusions** ‚Äì Summarize key findings on aircraft safety.
5. **Recommendations** ‚Äì Provide actionable steps to minimize operational risk.

## üîç Key Insights

### 1. **Aircraft Risk Profiles**
- **Cessna** aircraft show the **highest accident frequency** (due to widespread general aviation use).
- **Mooney** aircraft show the **lowest recorded accident frequency**.
- **Boeing** models display **lower accident rates**, aligned with commercial operation standards.

### 2. **Contributing Factors**
- Accidents are **most frequent during landing**, indicating a critical risk phase.
- **VMC (Visual Meteorological Conditions)** had more accidents than IMC, suggesting issues with weather-related judgment or pilot experience.
- **Three-engine reciprocating aircraft** showed the highest fatal injury averages.

### 3. **Temporal Patterns**
- Peak accident rates occur in **July**, suggesting risks tied to high-traffic summer months.
- A spike in fatal injuries occurred between **1990‚Äì2000**, likely linked to aging fleets and general aviation growth.
- **Pilot** or privately - operated flights contributed to most of the accidents.
- Most accidents occurred between **1980-2020**

## ‚úÖ Recommendations

1. **Aircraft Selection**
   - Prioritize modern, commercial-grade aircraft (e.g., Boeing).
   - Avoid aging or less reliable general aviation models.

2. **Pilot Training**
   - Emphasize simulator-based training for landing and adverse weather conditions.

3. **Operational Scheduling**
   - Increase inspections and risk controls during July and other high-traffic months.

4. **Technology Adoption**
   - Equip aircraft with real-time safety monitoring systems.
   - Continuously update operational manuals based on recent data trends.
